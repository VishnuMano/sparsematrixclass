# Issues because I forgot and had to remember after winter break:
* Eigen vector has 0's in it
* Eigen vector is not being properly converted to SRLE -> But its close! Test case did show its working, but random case does NOT
* Optimize Optimize Optimize


# Optional:
* Write actual tests! Secondary effect -> make Dr. Fredericks proud


Good news: We're close and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel :)
